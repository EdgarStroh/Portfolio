        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br><br><strong>Liability for content</strong><br><br>
            The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para. 1 TMG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we, as a service provider, are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove these contents immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for links</strong><br><br>
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these foreign contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not identifiable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, unreasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
            The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as the content on this page was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. If you still become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for an appropriate notice. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.<br><br><strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
            The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data (e.g. name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, if possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent. <br>
            We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible. <br>
            The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertisements and information materials is hereby expressly rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the case of unsolicited sending of advertising information, e.g., by spam emails.<br>
